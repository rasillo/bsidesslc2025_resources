# LLM-Assisted Risk Management for Small Teams and Small Budgets
## Intro blurb
What: My talk will help small, underfunded teams identify relevant risk management opportunities and iteratively improve defenses in small, manageable ways, by using LLM's to parse through complex risk management and IT architecture security documents from NIST and Microsoft.

Results: My talk will provide this information in order to help attendees create a contextually-aware, generatively assisted action plan for improvements to an organization's cybersecurity stance that can run on basic machinery, with minimal prior skills.

Why? If you gain a better understanding of your organization's risk status, you are better equipped to defend against lone wolf hackers, motivated teams, hacktivists, and Advanced Persistent Threats.

## Files inside this repo
I'm including several copies of files in their original PDF format, and then their cleaned and converted Markdown format. I'm also including a small .sh script to pull down the Docker images which are needed to run Ollama and OpenWebUI.

These files were converted using [Docling](https://https://github.com/docling-project/docling), a Python package that can scan through PDF files (using easyOCR and other widgets).
